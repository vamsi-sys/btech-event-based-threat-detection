# 🔐 Cyber Threat Detection Using Artificial Neural Networks with Event Profiles

This project implements an AI-based Security Information and Event Management (AI-SIEM) system that detects cyber threats using both deep learning (LSTM, CNN) and classical machine learning (SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes) models. The approach is based on event profiling and TF-IDF vectorization of attack signatures.
